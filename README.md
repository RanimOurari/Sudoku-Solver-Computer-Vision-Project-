# Sudoku-Solver-Computer-Vision-Project-
This project was developed as part of the Computer Vision course in the Joint Master of Computer Science program in Switzerland. It aims to solve a Sudoku puzzle directly from an input image, implementing a full computer vision pipeline to detect, extract, and recognize handwritten digits before sending the puzzle to a provided solver.
